# Identicon

A small Elixir command line utility that takes a string and creates an identicon based on that string. The output should always be identical, given the same input. An identicon is a grid of 5 x 5 squares, with each square 50 x 50 pixels, and the total grid is 250 x 250 pixels. The grids are colored according to the identicon algorithm, and each identicon is symmetrical along its vertical center axis.

Test change.
